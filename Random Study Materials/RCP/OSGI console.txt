7. Running a standalone OSGi server

This chapter will show how to run Equinox as a OSGi standalone runtime.

In your Eclipse installation directory identify the file org.eclipse.osgi*.jar. This file should be in the "plugin" folder. Copy this jar file to a new place, e.g. c:\temp\osgi-server. Rename the file to "org.eclipse.osgi.jar".

Start your OSGi server via the following command.

java -jar org.eclipse.osgi.jar -console 
You can use "install URL" to install a bundle from a certain URL. For example to install your bundle from "c:\temp\bundles" use:

install file:c:\temp\bundles\plugins\de.vogella.osgi.firstbundle_1.0.0.jar 
Tip

You properly need to correct the path and the bundle name on your system.
You can start then the bundle with start and the id.
